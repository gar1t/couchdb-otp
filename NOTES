- Brazenly using 'couchdb' as the application name and module prefix. This
  might be off-putting. CouchDB uses 'couch' and we may cause confusion. The
  thinking, however, is that Erlang developers (the community that would likely
  care about namespace issues, aside from the CouchDB dev team) won't care
  about close collisions as they'll use the `couchdb` interface.

- couch_app starts a bunch of apps. This is typically handled elsewhere --
  usually when starting an Erlang release (dependecies are automatically
  started using dependencies in .app file).

- We want to keep the dependencies to a mininum, so not requiring oauth, ssl,
  ibrowse, and mochiweb (maybe others).

- Using application config to locate ini files.

- Not possible to start couch_server with no config -- breaks in init/1 looking
  for "max_db_open" (no default vals). We'll cover for this using a hack in
  couchdb_sup. The general idea is that we should work with sensible defaults
  without any external config.

- couch_uuids:new/0 looks crufty - it's a gen_server call and not used. The
  server is never started by couch, so I'm guessing couch_uuids:random/0 is the
  correct function (but there are calls to new/0, possibly also not used).

- This has nothing to do with the project, but it's surprising that the content
  type for a json response over http is text/plain and not application/json.

- delayed_commit is really a big deal - no lie. Docs/sec around 20 with it off,
  up to 280 with it on. Bulk writes bumped up to over 2000. These are all
  consistent with http://books.couchdb.org/relax/reference/high-performance.
