 To Do
=======

In no particular order (brain dump):

- Replication
- Documentation
- Sample apps (e.g. blog, etc.)
- Tests
- Attachments
- Map/reduce (views?)
- Indexes
- Tasks (e.g. /_active_tasks needs a proc, probably an optional service)

Selecting from Views
====================

Currently the API only supports *keys* and it looks like it could support doc
IDs as well, though I'm not sure how that works. The HTTP interface accepts
startkey_docid and endkey_docid, but I'm not sure how it works.
