 To Do
=======

In no particular order (brain dump):

- API support for adding views (sugar)
- Support for reduce ops
- Replication
- Improved errors for Futon (in scope? woud be nice)
- Documentation
- Sample apps (e.g. blog, etc.)
- Tests
- Attachments

Selecting from Views
====================

Currently the API only supports *keys* and it looks like it could support doc
IDs as well, though I'm not sure how that works. The HTTP interface accepts
startkey_docid and endkey_docid, but I'm not sure how it works.

Shutting Down
=============

Calling application:stop(couchdb) after the JavaScript port has started is a
big mess (add to a document and then select from a JavaScript view to start the
port). We need a clean shutdown. The couchjs process is closed cleanly - but
sasl complains.
